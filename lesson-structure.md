## Thoughts on lesson structuring

### Peter from Group 1

Another aspect is how to structure a single lesson. In my sessions I usually structure them along these lines:
- standup round in which each student shows some recent work
- new concepts/features
- short break
- reiteration of old concepts

So I make the first hour a little heavier and the second hour a little lighter. Like recently we did a blog application and the first hour would be adding a new feature, like creating a blog post. And the second hour would be adding links between pages and using CSS to make it prettier. I found this structure helpful - especially since I do the 7pm to 9pm sessions during the week where energy levels seem to be lower than on the weekends.

So having something (a mockup, a html page) to improve upon iteratively helps in this regard. Or, in other words, I would be more hard pressed applying this structure by purely following the chapters in the book.

We did follow this tutorial: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

- we deliberately changed the name of the main entity from Article to Post to prevent mindless copy and paste
- we also didn't do the tutorial precisely in that order; instead we adapted it to expand on stuff we had introduced before

You can see the result at: https://github.com/ReDI-School/group1-blog (equivalent to the end of chapter 5 in the tutorial)

You will find tags for the different stages of the project in that repo. These tags can be used as reference implementations.
This proved crucial in allowing students who missed one session to catch up.

In terms of pacing, we spent about 5 sessions on this with little explanations. I think 7-8 sessions would be better to add more explanations of what you are actually doing.

You could speed (covering of particular material) it up considerably by going pure copy and paste. But I don't think that's a wise choice.

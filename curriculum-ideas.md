## HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- You could start with an ideation session and do paper mockups
- Then you teach students about HTML and CSS and produce and HTML mockup
- Then you introduce JavaScript and add some interactivity
- Then you introduce Rest and move some of the code to the backend
- Maybe later you replace the backend with a different implementation/framework
